# ðŸ“¦ A container running GNOME Shell via xvfb

_:warning: Disclaimer: I have very little to no experience with Docker / Podman. I am sure that many aspects of this project can be improved significantly! Please report any suggestions via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Schneegans/gnome-shell-pod/issues)!_

## ðŸŽ‰ The Idea

Developing high-quality extensions for GNOME Shell is challenging due to various reasons.
One major issues is the lack of continuous integration possibilities.
So I thought: Why not try getting GNOME Shell running on the runners of GitHub Actions?

Of course I know that this is exactly what Docker & Podman are not designed to be used for...


## ðŸ”§ How Does It Work?




## âœ… How Do I Use It?

Some notes:

```bash
podman build -t ghcr.io/schneegans/gnome-shell:1.0.0 .
podman push ghcr.io/schneegans/gnome-shell:1.0.0
podman run --rm -it gnome-shell:1.0.0
podman cp $(podman ps -q -l):/opt/Xvfb_screen0 . && convert xwd:Xvfb_screen0 capture.jpg && eog capture.jpg
podman stop $(podman ps -q -l)

# podman exec -it $(podman ps -q -l) gdbus call --session --dest org.gnome.Shell --object-path /org/gnome/shell/extensions/flypie --method org.gnome.Shell.Extensions.flypie.ShowMenu 'Example Menu'
```

## :octocat: Contributing

You should also start your commit message with **one** applicable emoji.
This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit. Make many but small commits!
